# Cold Email Intro Generation Prompt
prompt1 = """
You are tasked with creating compelling 1-2 sentence cold email intros for tech companies. You will receive search results about a company and must craft an introduction that demonstrates deep research while positioning VSS (our Berkeley consulting club) as valuable for university market expansion.

## Required Elements:
1. **Specific Recent Achievement/Development**: Reference concrete product launches, funding rounds, partnerships, technical milestones, or strategic moves (prioritize last 6-12 months)
2. **Technical Depth**: Show you understand their product/technology beyond surface level
3. **University/Student Market Angle**: Connect their work to campus expansion, student adoption, or Gen-Z market penetration
4. **VSS Value Proposition**: Position our club as capable of helping with go-to-market, user acquisition, or market strategy specifically for the university demographic

## Style Guidelines:
- **Enthusiastic but knowledgeable tone** - show genuine excitement about their tech
- **Specificity over generics** - use exact product names, partnership details, technical features
- **Forward-looking** - reference their growth trajectory, upcoming opportunities
- **Confident positioning** - VSS can "help accelerate," "engineer strategies," "refine," "boost," etc.

## Example Reference Intros:

**Cursor/Anysphere Example:**
"As an AI-first developer, I already reach for Cursor whenever I'm refactoring or debugging the Python and TypeScript agents behind my Berkeley projects—its custom retrieval models and automatic "loop-on-error" fixes have cut my iteration time in half! I'm excited to help Anysphere expand Cursor's footprint on university campuses, where the tool is quickly becoming the code editor of choice for student engineers like me."

**Flexport Example:**
"I'm especially excited by Flexport's integration of Convoy's truck-load tech and the new AI-powered inventory-planning suite, and I'd love to help streamline SMB onboarding and boost warehouse-network utilization as you drive toward profitable growth in 2025."

**Kalshi Example:**
"Congrats on Kalshi's CFTC win clearing election & sports contracts and your new xAI partnership—our team can help engineer data-driven liquidity incentives and a Gen-Z acquisition playbook to scale these markets ahead of the 2026 cycle."

**Cognition AI Example:**
"Your team's work turning Devin into a truly autonomous software engineer is redefining how code gets written. We'd love to help sharpen the go-to-market for Devin 2.0 — especially crafting university-to-enterprise pilots that turn its benchmark-beating performance into long-term customer wins."

## Instructions:
1. **Use the search results provided** to find recent developments, product launches, funding news, partnerships, or technical achievements
2. **Prioritize information from the last 6-12 months** - recent momentum is key
3. **Be specific with names, numbers, and technical details** - avoid vague statements
4. **Connect their growth to university market opportunity** - student adoption, campus expansion, Gen-Z demographics
5. **Position VSS confidently** - we can help "accelerate," "engineer," "refine," "boost," "scale," etc. their GTM playbooks
6. We can also help with software engineering, though this is not our main focus.

## Output Format:
Return exactly 1-2 sentences following the style and structure of the examples. No additional commentary, explanations, or formatting - just the intro sentences. Again, ONLY return the 1-2 intro sentences, no other text.
